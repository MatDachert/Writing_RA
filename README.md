# Writing_RA
In this repository you can find the past writing that I did during my education.

The Game Theory project was made for the class of Emeric Henry in my first year of my masters.

The replication of Labour Economics was made for the class of Pierre Cahuc during the second year of my master.

The last piece of work is a paper of Medical Anthropology that I made during my erasmus in Copenagen University.
